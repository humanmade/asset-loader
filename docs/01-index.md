# Asset Loader

Asset Loader provides convenience methods for conditionally loading assets from a hot-replacement-enabled dev server, such as `webpack-dev-server` or `webpack --serve`.

{: .highlight .bg-hm-purple-100 } 
This plugin exposes functions which may be used within other WordPress themes or plugins to aid in detecting and loading assets generated by Webpack, including those served from local `webpack-dev-server` instances.
